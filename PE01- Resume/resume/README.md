The program uses predefined user data such as personal details, education, skills, work experience, and projects. These details are stored as JSX elements within the Resume.js file. No dynamic input is required from the user.


The app is built using React, a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. The main component, Resume.js, organizes the resume content into sections like header, education, skills, experience, and projects. Styling is applied through an external CSS file, Resume.css, which ensures the layout adheres to the specified requirements, including a background color of rgba(189, 251, 4, 1) and default black text. The App.js file imports and renders the Resume component, serving as the entry point for the application.

Output
The program generates a responsive web page showcasing the user's resume with a professional design. The final output can be viewed in a browser using the development server provided by React (npm start). The design aligns with the sample output provided in the assignment.
